# Motivation

I have a macOS machine as my power machine, not a Linux <sup>[1]</sup>, because
of
- Artistic hardware design and UI.
- Better screen resolution.
- Copyright issues<sup>[2]</sup>.

However, to be confident my work is POSIX-compatible, I still wish to test my
work on a Linux. The approaches are:
- Install a virtual machine instance that hosts a Linux
- Install a container that hosts a Linux.

Alternatives I did not pick:
- Buy a new Linux machine: no frequent use of Linux to justify the price.
- Connect to a hosted server (e.g. Google Cloud or Azure): Internet required;
  still need money.
- Install a secondary operating system: no way to share files between them.

> <sup>[1]</sup>No Windows either. Apparently, Windows is not suitable for
general-purpose development except for Windows-specific stuff due to lack of
a ecosystem compatible with the academia and industry norm.<br>
<sup>[2]</sup> For business reasons, Apple ties macOS to hardware. Therefore,
as far as copyright is concerned, there is no way to run a macOS machine inside
a virtual machine. However, Linux distributions are well-supported to reside in
one.
