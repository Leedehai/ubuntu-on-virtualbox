# Installing a headless Ubuntu On Docker

**Who is this guide not for**:
If you want to install a Ubuntu desktop version (with GUI), Docker is not right
for you (unless with special techniques). Frankly, this entire repository is not
right for you as it only deals with headless Ubuntu.

**Key parameters**:
- Host OS: macOS 10.15, x86_64. But I think Windows is fine.
- Guest OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, server version, x86_64.
- Docker: Docker Desktop for macOS 2.3.0.3, embedding Docker Engine 19.03.8.

TODO: The fans spin like crazy. Possibly a [bug with Docker](http://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3499) that only occurs on macOS.
